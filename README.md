# Home Loan Default Predictions

**The Project:**
  For my Capstone project I chose to do a data analysis over the Home Default Credit Risk competition on Kaggle.

**The Goal:**
  The focus of this project is to create a model that can predict if an individual will default on their home loan or not. Once the predictions are done we will list the features that affect the result the most and present it as a potential risk factor to the customer.

**The Problem:**
* There are many factors that affect the results
* 

**The Solution:**
* 


**The Process**

1. Explore & Clean data 
2. Model the data
3. Find the feature importances to list out to see which factors were the biggest contributors

**The Data:** 

The data was provided by the Home Default Credit Risk Competition on Kaggle

**The Metrics:** 

The main metric used was ROC_AUC scoring.

**The Models Chosen:**
* The baseline model - Random Forest
* Other models used - Gradient Boosting

# Conclusion
* The biggest feature importances were the opinions of the individual if the vaccine was effective or not. Some of the other high impacting features were if the individual had health insurance or not and if they had any good behaviors prior to the spread of the virus like washing their hands. The model was able to predict with a ROC_AUC score of 0.85 for the 

# Future Recommendations
1. Gather more data to further analyze behavioral patterns
2. Apply feature engineering to improve model performance.
3. Take a psychological approach and see if anything changes.
