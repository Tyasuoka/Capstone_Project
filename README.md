# Home Loan Default Predictions

**The Project:**
  For my Capstone project I chose to do a data analysis over the Home Default Credit Risk competition on Kaggle.

**The Goal:**
  The focus of this project is to create a model that can predict if an individual will default on their home loan or not. Once the predictions are done we will list the features that affect the result the most and present it as a potential risk factor to the customer.

**The Problem:**
* There are many factors that affect the results
* There is a lot of 

**The Solution:**
* 


**The Process**

1. Explore & Clean data 
2. Model the data
3. Find the feature importances to list out to see which factors were the biggest contributors

**The Data:** 

The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/overview) was provided by the Home Default Credit Risk Competition on Kaggle

**The Metrics:** 

The main metric used was ROC_AUC scoring.

**The Models Chosen:**
* The baseline model - Random Forest
* Other models used - Gradient Boosting

# Conclusion
* The biggest feature importances 

# Future Recommendations
1. Gather more data with less null values
2. Apply feature engineering to improve model performance
3.

**The Data**
The raw datasets were too big for github so they have not been added to this Repository.
The data is based off of [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/overview) Kaggle Competition.

**Models: Below you will find model documentation**

* [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)
* [Gradient Boost](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html)
